# LSA-application-to-DQD
This source code has been used for research purpose to determine importance of some terms per a corpus of document.
The code is based upon the gensim library and connected to the work of deerwester.
'documents' is an array making up the corpus. Future improvements may connect the corpus to external files
'stoplist' is another array storing a list of terms which the LSImodel should not cater for, thus improving efficiency. It might be customizable as
per different corpus of documents being used
'num_topics' is set to 10, but might differ in other cases for better efficiency.
